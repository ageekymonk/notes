       - The fund can grow the number of shares. The investor can sell their
         share anytime and mutual fund will give back their money. So they have
         to keep some cash to do that.
     - Closed Ended Funds
       - The fund shares are fixed. If the investor has to sell he will sell in
         market to another seller. This way the mutual fund does not need to
         keep cash in hand.
