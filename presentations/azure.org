   1. Create Generalized and Specialized Images
   2. Convert VHDX to VHD
   3. Upload a VHD to azure
   4. Copy blob container from one storageacct to another using powershell and azcopy
   5. Enable Powershell and connect via remote powershell
   6. Enable extensions like custom script, vm access, DSC
   7.
** Powershell
   1. Move Azure VM with static IP to another Subnet
      #+begin_src bash
        Get-AzureVM -ServiceName TestVMCloud -Name TestVM `
        | Remove-AzureStaticVNetIP `
            | Update-AzureVM
        Get-AzureVM -ServiceName TestVMCloud -Name TestVM `
        | Set-AzureSubnet -SubnetNames Subnet-2 `
            | Update-AzureVM
      #+end_src
   2. Enable Remoting

      Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\client\TrustedHosts -Value *
      Enter-PSSession -ComputerName 104.210.114.4 -Credential (Get-Credential)
      #+end_src
** Points to ponder
  - Affinity Group
    - Deprecated
  - Availability Set
    - upto 3 Fault Domains and 20 Update Domain in ARM Model
    - upto 2 Fault Domains and 5 update domain in ASM Model
  - Azure Classic Architecture
    - Uses Container called Cloud Service
    - Cloud Service is exposed to public internet
    - Cloud service will have virtual IP.
    - Cloud service has a connection which could be accessed anywhere in the world called endpoint
  - A standard disk is expected to handle 500 IOPS or 60MB/s throughput
  - A P30 Premium disk is expected to handle 5000 IOPS or 200MB/s throughput
  - Types of states
    1. Running
    2. Stopped (deallocated)
       - billed only for storage not for compute.
       - IP address both private and public are lost unless they are static
       - This is done via portal or cli
    3. Stopped
       - Shutdown from inside the VM
       - Billed for both storage and compute
       - IP addresses are not lost
  - Azure Host Cache Types
    - RW Cache
    - RO Cache
    - None

** Basic vs Standard Tier
   | Basic            | Standard            |
   |------------------+---------------------|
   | 18% Cheaper      |                     |
   | Dev Only         | Production Workload |
   | 300 IOPS         | 500 - 5000 IOPS     |
   | A0 - A4          |                     |
   | No Loadbalancing |                     |
   | No Autoscale     |                     |

** Instance Sizes
   1. A0 - A11 Supported in Standard Tier
   2. A8 - A11 Support High performace CPU and used for compute intensive
   3. A8 - A9 has secondary NIC to RDMA backend network
   4. D instance is Xeon Processors and 20% Faster than A instances
   5. D instance has locally attached SSD Disk
   6. D_V2 has same form factor as D instances. But Next generation processors
   7. D15_V2 has 20 cores, 140G RAM
   8. F Series is based on 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon® E5-2673 v3 (Haswell) processor
   9. F series has the same CPU performance as the Dv2-series of VMs but low price.
   10. From F series and anything new the number denotes the number of cores
   11. G series has largest memory size
   12. H Series is compute intensive
   13. Standard vs premium storage => upto per disk  500 IOPS vs 5000 IOPS
   14. DS or GS instance size supports premium storage
   15. DS_V2 more cpu speed and more memory. Processor speed is upto 64% faster than DS

** OS Images
   - Types
     1. Specialized
        - Golden / Snapshot VM Image
        - Includes Machine ID, hostname, static IP
        - When you need exact duplicated of the VM
     2. Generalized
        - Windows: sysprep
        - All images in azure image gallery
        - For Linux need to install azure VM agent
        - Run waagent -deprovision and shutdown the VM
   - Azure supports only Generation 1 VHD Images
   - Max Size of OS Disk is 127 GB and Data disk is 1 TB

** Loadbalancer
   - Layer 4 Loadbalancing
   - Uses 5 tuple hash stickiness
   - Direct Server Return (floatint IP) is used with SQL Server Always on availability Group
   - Health check can be tcp or http
   - Interval for health check is 15 seconds. Expected response with 31 seconds
** ACL
   - Whitelist for Endpoint Access
   - <= 50 ACL Per Endpoint
   - You can specify network ACLs for endpoints only
   - By default all traffic is permitted to the endpoint
     -
** Availability Sets
   - Virtual Machines in an availability set should be within a same cloud service
   - 2 VMs in an AV Set gives you 99.95 SLA
   - 2 VMs in an AV Set will be in a different Fault Domain
   - Each AV Set has 5 update domains
   - For autoscaling you need availability set
   -
* Azure Networking
** Virtual Network
   - ASM Model vs ARM Model
     - Cloud Services Vs Network Interface
     - Endpoint Vs NSG
     - Service Management REST API vs Resource Manager REST API
     - XML Vs JSON
     - Serial Vs Parallel
     - Non Idempotent Vs Idempotent

** Network Security Group
*** Overview
    - Bunch of inbound and outbound rules to restrict traffic to your VMs
    - Can be applied to Subnet or to Individual VMs
      #+BEGIN_NOTES
      In AWS we use NACL at subnet level and Security Group at VM Level
      Security Group in AWS is stateful and NACL is stateless
      #+END_NOTES
    - Azure NSG is stateless
    - NSG is limited to region. NSG can only apply to resources within the region
    #+REVEAL: split
    - Default Rules:
      1. Allow all traffic from / to any node in your virtual network
      2. Allow all traffic from / to the loadbalancer (including internet)
      3. Allow only outbound traffic to the internet and block the inbound from internet
    - Special Rules:
      1. Key management services run in port 1688. Donot block outbound traffic on 1688
      2. DNS, DHCP and healthcheck are provided through virtualized host ip 168.63.129.16. Donot block this.

* Azure Storage
** Understanding the Jargons
   1. Storage Account
      - Namespace to store your data
   2. Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
      - Max acceptable time before the application fully recovers after disruptive event
      - RTO Measures maximum loss of availability during failures
   3. Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
      - Max acceptable data loss
** Classic Vs ARM Storage Accounts
   - ARM VMs cannot be deployed with ASM Storage Accounts and viceversa
   - Both needs a globally unique url. .*.core.windows.net
** Types of storage Services
   1. [[File Storage][File]]
   2. [[Table Storage][Table]]
   3. [[Queue Storage][Queue]]
   4. [[Blob Storage][Blob]]
** Storage Replication
   1. Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
      - Provides 3 replicas of the data within a region
      - 20 Gbps inbound 30 Gbps outbound
      - Replicas will be in separate fault and upgrade domain
        #+BEGIN_NOTES
        The data within a region is updated synchronously
        #+END_NOTES
   2. Geo Redundant Storage (GRS)
      - Total 6 replicas, three in local and three in other region
      - Data is available on the remote region only when microsoft declares a disaster in the region
      - Updates across regions are done asynchronously
      - 10 Gbps inbound 20 Gbps outbound
      #+BEGIN_NOTES
      The remote region is selected by azure
      #+END_NOTES
   #+REVEAL: split

      Storage Replication...
   1. Geo Redundancy with read only access
      - Can read data from remote region before microsoft declares disaster
   2. Premium Storage
      - This has to be done at creation time
      - Only Local redundancy is supported
      - Low latency high performance persistent SSD
      - Used for VM Disks (page blobs)
   3. Zone Redundant Storage
      - Can store Block blobs only. Available only during Storage Account Creation
      - Replicated across 2-3 facilities in a region or across region if not available in a region
      - Not supported for VMs
      - 99.99% Read

   4. SAS

   Storage Key Facts
   1. Keep Primary and share secondary. This way to revoke access regenerate secondary key
   2. We have primary and secondary for periodic key rollover

   #+REVEAL: split
   Custom Domains
   With Downtime
     - Add a CNAME to your blob service endpoint
     - Register the domain with your azure storage account
   Without Downtime
     - In your public DNS create a CNAME record that maps asverify.subdomain.yourmain.com to asverify.account.blob.core.windows.net
     - Register the domain with your azure

   Currently you cannot bind custom domain with your own ssl certificates
   Workaround: CORS

          application by Azure AD using the user account information from the third-party SaaS application
        - password storage and replay is done using a web browser extension or mobile app
        - By using a custom browser plugin, AAD automates the user’s sign in process via securely retrieving
          application credentials such as the username and the password from the directory, and enters these
          credentials into the application’s sign in page on behalf of the user
        - Two use cases
          1. Administrator Manages Credential
          2. User Manages Credential
     3. Existing SSO

** Points to ponder
   - Azure EA Portal for Enterprise
   - Resource Locks
     - scoped at subscription, RG and Resource
     - Read only  and Do not delete
   - Azure security center
   - Key Vault
   - Operations Management Suite (OMS)
   - Enterprise Azure Roles
     1. Enterprise Admin
        - Top Level Account
        - Can Add department
     2. Department Admin
        - Manage department admins
     3. Account Owner
        - Add subscription
     4. Service Admin
        - No access to ea portal
   - Use Resource Group and Tags for organizing your resources
   - Max 15 tags per resource
   - Can more resources between subscription or resource groups
   - To move subscription it should be within same AD tenant
   - To control resources within subscription
     1. Policies
     2. RBAC
        - Defines what actions that a user or group can perform on a resource
        - users and groups are added to roles
        - Roles are applied to subscription or RG or Resource level
   - Three Roles
     1. Owner
        - allow all actions
     2. Contributor
        - all actions except writing or deleting role assignments
     3. Reader
   - Roles are applied to specific scopes. They are Subscription, RG, Resource
   - Role Anatomy
     1. Name
     2. Id
     3. Description
     4. IsCustom
     5. Assignable Scopes
     6. Actions Allowed
     7. Actions Not allowed
   - Azure policies
     - scoped at subscription, RG, Resource
     - Used for
       - Enforcing naming convention
       - Tag Requirements
       - Supported SKU
       - Supported Services
       - Restricting by region
     - Actions: deny, audit, append
     - Policy at parent scope cannot be overridden in child scope unless user is Owner of parent scope
   - Express route circuit per subscription is 10
