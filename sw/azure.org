** Terminologies
   - Azure compute unit: A1 instance has 100
   - Service Healing is migrating a VM from one failed host to a good one
   - Availability Set deploys VM in separate rack
   - Fault Domain is the physical rack
   - Upgrade Domain is to isolate VM for host upgrade.
   - Hybrid Connectivity to connect Azure with On Premise network

** General Info
   - When scaled up the VM has to be rebooted and all storage on temporary disk is lost
   - There are 3 Fault Domains for Resource Manager
   - There are 5 - 20 Upgrade Domains
   - Power and Switch in a rack is a single point of failure
   - Hybrid Connectivity
     1. Point to site
        - Connect up to 128 Client machines using certificate authentication to azure network
        - 80 - 200 Mbps
        - Remote Dev / test or for secure remote admin
     2. Site to Site
        - Connect on premise with azure using IPSEC over internet
        - 80 - 200 Mbps
     3. Express Route
        - Direct connectivity through Exchange provider (colocated dc) or network service provider to azure
        - 10 Mbps - 10 Gbps

** Azure Media Services
*** Terminologies
    - Assets
      Digital Media Files (audio/video/images/closed caption)
*** Points to Ponder
    - Assets are mapped to a BLOB container in azure storage
    - Files inside an assets as stored as BLOB in BLOB Container
    - An Asset should contain unique instance of media content
    - Asset Encryption
      - No encryption
      - Storage Encrypted
        Encrypted locally and stored
      - Common Encryption Protected
        Encrypted with common Encryption or PlayReady DRM
      - Envelope Encryption Protected
        Protecting HTTP Live streaming
    - BLOB container is the boundary point for access control
    - Azure storage account can host unlimited number of BLOB Container under 500TB
    - Locator provides an entry point for accessing files within an asset
    - Locator Types
      1. OnDemandOrigin
         Used for streaming
      2. SAS URL
         Used for upload and download of media files from azure storage
    - Jobs are used to process audio/video
    - Jobs contain tasks
    - Channels processes live stream content. It is 5 per account
    - Programs allow admins to control publishing and storage of live streaming content
    - ArchiveWindowLength property that says how long the recorded content will be retained. (5min - 25 hours)
    - Streaming Endpoint delivers content directly to client player app or CDN
    - Streaming Endpoint supports live stream or Video on Demand
    - Scale unit 200 Mbps
    - 2 Streaming Endpoint per Media Service Account
*** CDN
    - Only public available BLOBs are cached using CDN
    - HTTPS is supported but you can't your certificates. You should use only CDN FQDN
    -

** MFA
   - Supports Telephone call, SMS, OTP, App Password, App generated Time based code
   -
** Azure Storage
*** VM Storage
    - Every VM Has atleast two disks. One for OS and other for temporary disk
    - A VM can have additional disks attached called data disks
    - Data disks and OS disk can have max size of 1 TB.
    - Data disks and OS disks are stored in azure storage.
    - Temporary disks is locally attached disk
    - There are 3 copies of VHD (disks) in azure storage in local region
    - Allows Geo redundancy where 3 more replica can be stored in other region
    - Data disk does not have caching by default. OS disk has caching by default
    - Max 4 data disk can have caching enabled.
*** Important Points
    - Store account hierarchy: account -> containers -> blobs
    - Storage account
      - can have 500 TB capacity
      - 20000 IOPS
      - LRS: 20 Gbps inbound 30 Gbps outbound
      - GRS: 10 Gbps inbound 20 Gbps outbound
      - Security through management certificate or name and authentication key
      - 4 endpoints: blobs, files, tables, queues
      - storage in azure is organized by containers.
    - Containers have 3 levels of security
    - If you want to recreate access key for storage account. Shut down all virtual machine before creation otherwise VM become unusable
    - Add-AzureRmVHD to upload vhd file. It uploads only the written data not empty zeros. Converts dynamic disk to fixed disk on upload
    - Azure only supports VHD
    - Save-AzureRmVHD only download written data.
    - Attaching existing disk use powershell / portal
    - To move Blob across accounts use Asynchronous blob copy
    - Azure Storage resources are divided into stamps.
    - Multiple storage account in a stamp. Each stamp has an ip
    - Intra stamp copy is instant. Inter stamp copy is asynchronous and will take time
    - For optimum performance:
      - Implement RAID 0 (disk stripping with no parity) or storage spaces (one column per disk)
      - Group multiple disk to large volume
      - Enable Readwrite caching
    - Types of storage
      1. Standard
         - Based on Page blobs, supports geo redundancy
         - 500 IOPS per disk , 1 TB Max

         - Supports Readwrite, Readonly, None caching for Data disk
         - Supports Readwrite, Readonly caching for os disk
         - Max 4 data disk can have caching enabled
      2. Premium
         - Upto 5000 IOPS per disk
         - DS, GS, DS_V2 instance
         - Local Redundancy only
         - Only Read only caching supported on data disk or No caching. Readonly is default
         - Read Write and Read only caching supported on os disk
         - 32 TB disk max per account
         - Three sizes
           1. P10 128GB/500IOPS/100MBps
           2. P20 512GB/2300IOPS/150MBps
