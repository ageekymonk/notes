* Docker
** Components
   In the beginning, docker was a monolithic implementation but with the moby project it has been split into several components. Many of the components are community driven.
   The components are
   1. Docker CLI
   2. dockerd
   3. containerd
*** Docker CLI
    It is the cli for docker. Docker cli communicates with the dockerd, which is the docker daemon using the api. All the logic is implemented inside the dockerd.
*** dockerd
    It is the docker daemon which exposes docker api. It manages container lifecycle by utilizing containerd. It can expose api in three sockets
    1. unix
    2. tcp
    3. fd
*** containerd
    Containerd is the industry standard container runtime. It is the container runtime that docker engine uses.
    containerd is the api facade for various runtimes and OS. This abstracts away the syscalls or OS specific functionality to run containers.
    It manages the complete container lifecycle of its hostsystem

    Things it can do
      - containerd cli can be used to pull and push images
      - containerd cli can be used to run an image
      - You can plug in any container runtimes like runc

    Things it cannot do
      - containerd does not do build. Does not have docker composeS

**** runc
    runc is a cli for running applications packaged to the OCI format.

**** ctr
     It is a cli for containerd for debugging and development purpose.

**** shim
     This allows for daemonless containers. It is the parent process for all the containers. It helps to
     1. Allows runtimes (runc) to exit after start.
     2. Keeps stdio and other fds open, in case containerd / docker restarts. This way container can keep running even if docker restarts.
     3. This also helps to get exit status of containers without docker being parent for the containers.

*** Debugging
    Looking at the process history using ~ps fxa~

      containerd-shim is root for the jenkins container. It can survive containerd restart and docker restart.
