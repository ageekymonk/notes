* Networking
  - Three pillars of networking
    1. CNM
       - Container Network Model
       - Design for Docker Networking
       - Competing standard is CNI. This is for kubernetes.
       - Components
         1. Sandbox
            - Platform agnostic concept. In linux it is namespace
         2. Endpoint
            - This is network interface
         3. Network
            - Connected Endpoints
    2. Libnetwork
       - Real world implementation of CNM
       - Pluggable architecture
       - Control Plane and Management Plane
    3. Drivers
       - Different network types for libnetwork are implemented by drivers
       - Data Plane
       - Local Drivers are shipped by docker, Remote drivers are by 3rd party
  - Network Drivers
    1. bridge
    2. host
    3. none
    4. overlay
    5. macvlan
    6. ipvlan
  - Bridge Driver
    - Default driver
    - bridge network is the docker0 network which is present in all docker hosts. This is the default.
    - Single Host Networking
    - Useful for local development
    - External access to containers are done via port mapping
    - Bridge is also called vswitch / virtual switch
    - similar to default bridge, docker0, but with additional features
    - Also we can create docker_gwbridge and use it for communication with swarm nodes on different hosts
    - To create bridge network
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      docker network create -d bridge --subnet 10.0.0.1/24 ps-bridge
      #+END_SRC
  - overlay
    - Can span multiple hosts
    - Precondition to create overlay networks are
      1. Needs access to key value store. Supports consul, etcd, zookeeper
      2. cluster of hosts with connectivity to key value store
      3. properly configured engine daemon on each host on the swarm
    - Control plane is encrypted by default
    - Data plane can also be optionally encrypted
    - Overlay driver vxlan to build the overlay network
    - End of each VXLan Tunnel is the VTEP (VXlan tunnel Endpoint)
    - Can separate data plane and control plane into different network
  - MACVLAN
    - way to attach containers to existing networks and VLANs
    - Ideal for apps that are not ready to be fully containerized
    - Uses MACVLAN Network type
    - Each container gets a HW Mac address and ip address on the underlay network
    - Each container is visible on the underlay network
    - Requires Promiscuous mode
    - uses subinterfaces to process 802.1Q tags
  - Service Discovery
    - Service gets a Virtual IP (VIP) for loadbalancing
    - Behind the scenes it uses IPVS for transport layer loadbalancing
    - Name to IP Mapping are stored in Swarm KV Store
    - Container DNS and Docker Engine DNS are used to resolve DNS
    - Every container runs local DNS Resolver
    - Every Docker engine runs a DNS service
  - none network is used when the container does not need any network.
  - host network adds the container to the host network stack. You will find the container to have network identical to host
  - Default Network Drivers
    - bridge

* Docker Storage Drivers
** OverlayFS
   - Modern AUFS
   - Simple and Faster than AUFS
   - overlay driver uses OverlayFS to build and manage docker images and containers
   - There is two version of overlay driver. overlay and overlay2
   - Architecture
     [[file:images/overlayfs.jpg]]
   - Overlay driver works with single lower layer. So need hardlinks for implementation of multi layered images
   - Overlay2 driver natively works with multiple lower layer images.

* Best Practices
  1. Use SSD
  2. Use Data Volumes
* Docker Swarm
  - Components
    1. Swarm Manager
       - Filtering
       - Scheduling
    2. Discover services
       - Example: consul, zookeeper, etcd
  - Three scheduling stratergies
    1. Random
    2. Spread
    3. Binpack
       - Stopped containers are still considered for packing decision
* To Ponder
  - deis
  - funktion
  - parse
  - calico
  -
* Namespaces
** PID
** Mount
** Networks
** IPC
** UTS
** User
   - Root inside container is no longer a real system root
   - Ranges used by user and group are in
     /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid
   - Flag to enable in docker daemon is
     --userns-remap=default
