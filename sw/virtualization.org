* Hypvervisor Types
** Paravirtualization
   - Xen
   - Early hardwares did not trap priviledged instructions in the guest operating
     system. What xen did was to find out all those instructions that did not
     trap and converted to instructions that did trap.
   - This was linux only
** HVM
   - Intel & AMD fixed those instructions that did not trap, they also
     reduced the number of priviledged instructions.
   - This helped to run beyond linux
   - Now on new hardware types, PV is not supported as it very slow

* Hypervisor
** Device Model

* ENA
  - Elastic Network adaptor
  - Uses custom asic
