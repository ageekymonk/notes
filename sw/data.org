* General
  - Nate silver used very simple model, he himself tweeted about it. The main
    work is data visualization and quantifying uncertainity
  - Bibliometrics is the statistical analysis of books, articles and other publications
  - Datascience is the merge of hacking skills, math and statistics knowledge
    and substantial expertise in the data domain

  - 80% of analytics is sums and averages -- Aaron kimball (CTO at zymergen)
  - Science was earlier done by empirical methods then in last 200 years
    Theoretical science has evolved and now computational is part of science.
    Now escience (data science) is also a part now
