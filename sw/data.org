* General
  - Nate silver used very simple model, he himself tweeted about it. The main
    work is data visualization and quantifying uncertainity
  - Bibliometrics is the statistical analysis of books, articles and other publications
  - Datascience is the merge of hacking skills, math and statistics knowledge
    and substantial expertise in the data domain
