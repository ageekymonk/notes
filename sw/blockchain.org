* Cryptocurrency
** Why
   - Traditional Banks takes care of
     1. Identity Management
     2. Allow Transactions
     3. Record Keeping
     4. Trust
** Major Players
  1. Bitcoin
  2. Litecoin
  3. Namecoin
  4. IoTA
** Bitcoin
   - Virtual Currency
   - Max 21 Million. 12 Millions are already there
   - Uses Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)
   - Bitcoin uses Sha256^2 hash which is they compute sha256 and then with the
     output of sha256 they find the sha256 again
   - Block contains
     - Block header -> H(Previous Block Hash || Nonce || Merkle Root )
     - Previous Block Hash
     - Nonce (It is the Proof Of Work Part)
     - Merkle Root
   - Partial Image Hash Puzzle
     - Find H(Previous Block Hash || Merkle Root || Nonce) < target
     - the guessing hash should have certain number of leading zeros in its hash, that
       should be less than number of leading zeros in target
   - Each block should contain atleast on coinbase transactions
   - Bitcoin scripts
     - Language built for bitcoins
     - No turing complete, no loops
     - 
** Other
   - Hash Functions (Preimage -> H(x) -> Image)
     1. Preimage Resistance
        This means given H(x) it is difficult to find x
     2. Second Preimage Resistance
        Given x, it is computationally difficult to find x' which gives same H(x)
     3. Collision Resistance
        It is general to second point. H(x) == H(y) it is computationally
        difficult to find
   - Elliptical Curve Cryptography
     - ECDSA stands for Elliptical curve Digital Signature Algorithm
   - Bitcoin Address + Private Key = Bitcoin Wallet
   - Bitcoin Address is derived from ECDSA
   - 
* Hyperledger
** Hyperledger Fabric
   - Enterprise grade, Distributed Ledger with smart contracts
   - Higher Transactions per second
   - Components
     1. CA
     2. Peer
     3. Ordering service
   - cryptgen
     - generate certificates for org, orderer, peer, user
     - crypto-config.yaml
   - Genesis Block
     - First block of the blockchain
