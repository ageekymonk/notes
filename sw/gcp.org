* Differences with AWS
  1. Better UI
  2. Cloud Shell
  3. Faster Create Time
  4.
** Compute
   1. Can have custom cpu and memory size
   2. You can have read only disk attached to multiple instances
   3. rest and cli options are given in the webpage
   4. Shows cost in the page and even the breakup
   5. You can select processor
   6. You can add gpus
   7. Custom Metadata is supported
   8. Sustained usage it gives you discount
   9. Shows snapshot size based on incremental snapshot
   10. Restful UI
** Network
   1. Google does not support point to site VPN
   2. Network and subnet can span regions and zones
   3. VPC can span regions
   4. Each region has an Internet gateway and VPN Gateway
   5. We can make ephemeral ip to static.
   6. Firewall can be created for network/instance
   7. Firewall can allow deny based on ip, port and protocol
   8.
** Storage
   1. Cloud storage Vs S3. All classes have save throughput, low latency and
      high durability
   2. Autoscale disk size from initial to no limit
   3.
* GCP
** BigData
*** Cloud Dataflow
    - Data Processing Service
    - Supports both batch and stream
    -
*** Cloud DataProc
    - Hadoop and Spark
    -
*** Cloud Datalab
    - Interactive tool for data exploration, analysis, visualization and machine learning
    - Built on top of Jupyter
    -
*** Cloud Dataprep
    - Explore, clean, and prepare data for analysis
*** Cloud PubSub
    - Messaging Middleware
    -
** ML
*** Machine Learning Engine
*** Cloud Natural Language API
*** Cloud Translate API
*** Cloud Speech API
*** Cloud Video Intelligence
** Storage
*** BigTable
    - NoSQL Analytics
    - Terabytes to Petabytes
    - High Volume Writes
    - Latency in ms
    -
*** Cloud Storage
    - Equivalent to S3
    - Cannot nested Bucket
    - For high performance it is better to have few buckets and lots of objects
      inside it
    - Max 5TB file size
    - Storage Class
      1. MultiRegional
      2. Regional
      3. Nearline
      4. coldline
    - All classes have same throughput, low latency, high durability. Difference
      is in availability, storage durations,
*** Cloud Datastore
    - Supports ACID Transactions
    - NoSQL
    - 0 to terabytes
*** SQL
*** Spanner
    - SQL
