* Differences with AWS
  1. Better UI
  2. Cloud Shell
  3. Faster Create Time
  4.
** Compute
   1. Can have custom cpu and memory size
   2. You can pick persistent disks which can be standard or SSD
   3. You can also opt for local SSD for scratch space
   4. You can have read only disk attached to multiple instances
   5. Persistent disks can be resized while it is attached and running
   6. rest and cli options are given in the webpage
   7. Shows cost in the page and even the breakup
   8. You can select processor
   9. You can add gpus
   10. Custom Metadata is supported
   11. Sustained usage it gives you discount
       - For predefined machine types
       - vcpus and system memory for custom machine types
       - vcpus and system memory occupied by sole tenanat nodes
   12. Shows snapshot size based on incremental snapshot
   13. Restful UI
** Network
   1. Google does not support point to site VPN
   2. Network and subnet can span regions and zones
   3. VPC is of global scope. subnets are regional.
   4. Can create resources in a subnet which are in different zones.
   5. Dynamically increase the size of the subnet without affecting the existing resources
   6. Each region has an Internet gateway and VPN Gateway
   7. We can make ephemeral ip to static.
   8. Firewall can be created for network/instance
   9. Firewall can allow deny based on ip, port and protocol
   10. Organized in Regions and zones. (similar to aws region and aws
      availability zones)
   11. Interconnect options
       1. VPN
          - Uses Cloud Router
          - uses BGP
       2. Direct Peering
          - Not covered by googles SLA
       3. Carrier Peering
          - using partner network
          - Not covered by google SLA
       4. Dedicated Interconnect
** Storage
   1. Cloud storage Vs S3. All classes have same throughput, low latency and
      high durability
   2. Autoscale disk size from initial to no limit
* GCP
** Foundation
*** General
    - Resources are organzied in projects. Projects can be in folders. Folders
      can be in other folders. Above folders is organization node.
    - Folders are only available to G-Suite and Cloud Identity customers that
      have an organization resource
    - Each project has an unique project id that user choses. Project also has
      project name which is for user's reference. This is mutable. GCP assigns
      project number for each project. You cannot reuse project id after
      deletion. 
    - Notable organization roles are
      1. Organization policy administrator
      2. Billing Account Creator
      3. Project creator
    - Three types of IAM roles
      1. Primitive
         - They are coarse grained
         - Existed before introduction of cloud IAM
         - Owner (can do billing), Editor, Viewer
      2. Predefined
         - Finer grained roles for resources
      3. Custom
         - can be created at project or organization level. Cannot be created at
           folder level
         - If the predefined role that custom role uses changes, it is not
           inherited by custom role
    - Cloud Source Repositories
      - Allow any number of source repositories
    - Cloud Functions
      - Written in JS
    - Deployment Manager
    - StackDriver
      1. Monitoring, Logging, Trace, Error Reporting and Debugging
*** Loadbalancing
    - Divided based on
      1. Global vs Regional
         - Global Load balancing requires Premium Tier
         - Regional requires standard Tier

      1. External vs Internal
         - External Load Balancer - HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, Network TCP/UDP
         - Internal LB - Internal TCP/UDP LB
      2. Traffic Type
      3. Global Load Balancer
         1. HTTP(S) Load Balancer
         2. SSL Proxy
         3. TCP Proxy
      4. Regional Load Balancer
         1. Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancer
         2. Network TCP/UDP Load Balancer
      5. There are 5 types of loadbalancing
         1. Global HTTP(S)
            - TLS 1.0 and up is only supported
         2. Global SSL Proxy
            - TCP with SSL Offload
         3. Global TCP Proxy
            - TCP without SSL Offload
         4. Regional Network
         5. Regional Internal
      6. Managed Instance Groups
         - Can be regional or zonal
      7. Cloud CDN

*** Networking
    - VPC
      - Provides connectivity for Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, App Engine Flex
      - Subnets are regional
      - Instances with private IP can communicate with google API if you enable
        private google access for the subnet
      - VPC Peering allows connectivity across two VPC regardless of projects, organization
      - shared VPC
        - Connects projects within the same organization
        - Host project contains one or more shared VPC
        - Service project is a project that is attached to host project
        - A project that is neither host project or service project is a
          standalone project
        - When a host project is enabled, all of its VPC becomes shared vpc
        - App Engine Flexible cannot participate in shared vpc
      - Types of VPC Network
        1. Auto mode
           - subnet in each region is automatically created
        2. Custom mode
           - No subnets are created
