** Rules
*** Rule of Thirds
** Aperture
   - It is the size of the shutter opening to let the light in. Higher the value lower the size, as it is 1/something.
** Shutter Speed
** ISO
   - ISO Range
     |          Range | Uses                                                       |
     |----------------+------------------------------------------------------------|
     |         50-100 | Bright Light. Like Outdoors on sunny days                  |
     |            200 | Overcast or cloudy days                                    |
     |        400-800 | When light is dim but not yet dim                          |
     | 1600 and above | indoor or night shots. Sometimes for freezing sports shots |

** Techniques

    - Focus first and move to recompose the shot.
* How to Improve
** Get a Decent Camera
** Start Using Program Mode
   Rather than jumping straight to manual mode where you have to think about every possible settings,
   program mode helps you with aperture and shutter speed. You have to deal with focus and iso.
   This is a great for me.
** Stop Using the Review
** How to take Great Portrait
   1. Connect With Subjects
   2. Find the Location
   3.
