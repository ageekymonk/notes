* Review (2016)(4 books Read)
** Quiet by Susan Cain
   This introvert centered book by Susan Cain explores the world of introverts.
   This book helped me understand about myself a lot. Some of my quirks started to make
   sense and was a bit comfortable to know many of my fellow introverts have similar quirks.
   The book covered lot of ground about introverts like

   1. Who are introverts and some of famous introverts
   2. Quirks of introverts
   3. How the world treats an introverts and rise of extrovert centric world?
   4. Why did evolution spared the introverts ?
   5. Genetic connection to introvert nature
   6. Physiological differences of an introvert
   7. How Risk handling differs between introverts and extroverts
   8. Eastern culture and their emphasis on being an introvert
   9. Work place problems for an introvert and how to handle it
   10. Getting best out of being introvert and what to learn from extroverts
   11. Pseudo introverts and how they do it
   12. Introvert Extrovert couples
   13. Introvert kid. How to handle him/her?

   This is a good read not only for introverts but also for extroverts. Though extroverts might
   feel that their role is being downplayed a bit. I am not sure how the author could have avoided it.
   It was good to know that many like me have the same feelings. Overall it is a very informative and
   could be a self realizing one for introverts. For an extrovert, especially the one who is in
   relation with an introvert will know how to appreciate and handle an introvert. Overall it is a must
   read for an introvert and also to an extrovert who is living with an introvert (kid, spouse, friend)
** Autobiography of a Yogi
   This is a spiritual book. For an atheist or to someone who questions some of the theist thinking
   this is definite no no. This book can only be appreciated by
   1. Who is highly spiritual
   2. Who can appreciate an underlying message

   In this book the author Paramahansa Yogananda, describes his life journey. I personally felt that
   the author to get his message into the reader has used euphoric exaggerated miracles performed
   by his teachers as a tool. These miracles are felt by the author's mental self might not be
   actual physical experiences. But surprisingly though the content penetrates through your
   scientific mind and a kind of calmness is felt while reading this book. This book also gives
   us a glimpse of earlier 20th century india and US.

   My take away from this book is "Mind" is an important organ which has to be kept in harmony. If
   that can be achieved then body will be in harmony and healthy. The suggested way in this book
   is by kriya yoga. It is a form of meditation. Once i have got this message then i did not
   feel the need of reading through the pages of miracle performed by yogis.

   One can give it a try to read this but this book might not appeal to many. And also this book is
   quite long to sustain the interest.
** Radhayanam
   This is a short biography of M R Radha, an eminent stage and film actor, an ardent follower of periyar.
   The author gives us a glimpse of m r radha, through few events in the actors life. The book is filled
   with various quotes of the actor which are hilarious and thought provoking.

   Before reading this book, i did not know much about him other than a fact that he was an actor and he
   shot MGR. I liked m r radha's quotes, his views of life, his quirks and overall his healthy attitude. I also
   liked the way the author presented the life of m r radha succinctly.

   One thing that was missing from the book is the not so good side of m r radha. May be that was not much
   interesting about it. Any way i would recommend this book for tamil readers with atheist views.
** Girl with a dragon Tattoo
   This is a good thriller by Steig Larsson. I liked the slow build up of tempo, followed by a amazing twist.
   The author has given very detailed description for his main characters and also he has spend time to build
   a separate story for them. It was a nice read overall.

* Review (2017)
** A short history of nearly everything
   A highly informational but yet funny book by Bill Bryson. In this book he
   embarks a quest to explain some of the questions which your kid
   might ask like How do you weigh the earth, how do you find the distance
   between earth and sun, how old is the earth. He explains these
   questions without dwelling upon too much physics or math. Laid with anecdotes
   in lives of various scientists, he catalogs mankind's journey in various
   fields like physics, chemistry, archaeology, anthropology, etc to answer
   those basic questions about our universe. A must read for
   anyone who want to know more about our
   earth and beyond without any serious physics or math.
